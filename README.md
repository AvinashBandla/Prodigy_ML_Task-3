Prodigy Machine Learnining Task-3:

Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification
This project demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using the popular "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset. The goal is to classify images as either containing a dog or a cat. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and generating submission predictions.

Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:
1.Data Extraction and Preparation
2.Data Exploration
3.Data Preprocessing
4.Model Training and Evaluation
5.Generating Submission
6.Data Extraction and Preparation

First, the dataset is extracted from the provided ZIP files. This includes separating the dataset into training and testing sets.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

Conclusion
This project provides a basic workflow for image classification using SVM. Improvements can be made by experimenting with different models, image preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Scikit-image
Matplotlib
Plotly
TensorFlow (Keras)

How to Run:
Extract the dataset and place the train and test1 folders in the root directory.
Run the notebook or script step-by-step to execute the data preparation, training, and prediction generation processes.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this project as needed. Happy coding!
